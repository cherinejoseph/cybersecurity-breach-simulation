# Cybersecurity Breach Simulation – Forage

This project is based on a virtual experience program by **Deloitte** through [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). It simulates a real-world cybersecurity investigation following a suspected breach of an internal dashboard.

## 🧩 Scenario Overview

Daikibo Industrials, a manufacturing company, experienced a production halt. Around the same time, a news outlet leaked sensitive internal information. The client suspects that their internal telemetry dashboard may have been compromised.

The cybersecurity team was tasked with investigating potential unauthorized access through web activity logs to determine if an external attack (bypassing VPN access) was possible.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Determine if the alleged breach could have occurred from an attacker without VPN access
- Analyze the `web_activity.log` file for suspicious or automated activity
- Identify user IDs tied to suspicious request patterns

## 📂 Files Included

- `web_activity.log`: Provided log file containing network request activity  
- `how-to-read-logs.pdf`: Diagram from Forage explaining how to interpret the logs  
- `analysis-report.md`: My written summary of the investigation and conclusions  

> **Note:** All materials are provided by Forage for educational purposes only. No sensitive or proprietary data is included.

## 🛠️ Resources Used

- Manual log analysis in Visual Studio Code  
- Timestamp analysis and request pattern recognition  
- Documentation of findings in Markdown
